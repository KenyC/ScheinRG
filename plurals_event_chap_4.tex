\section*{Structure of the argument}

Schein attempts to show that the truth-condition of sentences like \cnextx{a} are unavailable if we assume that \quo{teach} denotes a 4-ary predicate (3 arguments of the verb + event)\footnote{Schein uses \emph{indirect} semantics, where a sentence first gets translated into a formula of some logical language, which itself receives a model-theoretic representation. I rephrase in terms of the more familiar \emph{direct} semantics of Heim and Kratzer, where sentences immediately translates to model-theoretic objects.}

\pex
\a Three video games taught every quarterback exactly two new plays. \label{quat}
\a \textbf{Observed truth-conditions:}\\
Every quarterback learned two new plays\\
They received instruction from three video-games.
\a \quo{teach} denotes an $eeevt$ predicate
\xe

An argument of impossibility is tricky to make: one needs to make sure that the reading is impossible to obtain under any auxiliary assumptions. In particular, Schein explores two classes of auxiliary assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Composition:} how quantifiers compose with one another.
\item \textbf{Denotation of $\dbb{teach}$:} what 4-way relation \quo{teach} denotes.
\end{enumerate}
%

\section{Preliminary confusions}
Before spelling out these assumptions, Schein seems to worry about a \quo{van Benthem problem} that obtains with modified numerals and events. 
The effect of \emph{exactly} may be nullified by focusing on specific sub-events. \cnextx is a simplified version of the problem. For instance, in $e'$, it is true that I read exactly two books while overall, I in fact read 3 books.

\cnextx{a} is a simpler instance of the problem that worries Schein ; in a characteristic manner, Schein chooses to illlustrate the problem with the complicated sentence in \cref{quat}

\pex
\a I read exactly two books.
\a 
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw [rounded corners = 20pt] (-2.5,0.5) rectangle (1.5,-2);
\draw [rounded corners = 20pt] (-2,-0.5) rectangle (1,-2);
\node at (1.5,0.5) {e};
\node at (1,-0.5) {e'};
\node at (-0.5,0) {I read book 1};
\node at (-0.5,-1) {I read book 2};
\node at (-0.5,-1.5) {I read book 3};
\end{tikzpicture}
\xe
%
Schein seems to consider the \quo{van Benthem} reading to be available. He wants a way to force readers to interpret the sentence within the big event $e$. He considers three ways to achieve this:

\pex
\a I read exactly two books in exactly 24 hours. \hfill (adverbial modifier)
\a I read exactly two books with the same title. \hfill (enriching descriptive content)
\xe
%
If $e'$ takes less than 24 hours and $e$ exactly 24 hours, then \clastx{a} can't possibly be talking about $e'$.

But Schein decides against these two ways of doing things

\begin{itemize}
\item Temporal adverbials because \quo{[they], one is prepared to concede, involve [quantification over] events in some crucial way}
\item \emph{same} because \quo{[they] hold mysteries of their own}
\end{itemize}
%
He prefers the following route which does the same thing that \emph{same} does with only material \quo{within the fragment that we are holding polyadic logical form responsible to}.

\section{Composition: quantifiers \& scope}

The truth conditions for \cref{quat} that we aim for should be true in the following scenario:

\ex \label{scenario}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (v1) at (2.5,1.5) {video-game 1};
\node (v2) at (-0.5,2.5) {play 1};
\node (v4) at (-0.5,0.5) {play 2};
\node (v5) at (2.5,-1) {video-game 2};
\node (v6) at (-0.5,-1) {play 3};
\node (v7) at (2.5,-2.5) {video-game 3};
\node (v8) at (-0.5,-2.5) {play 4};
\node (v9) at (-4,-2) {quarterback 1};
\node (v3) at (-4,1.5) {quarterback 2};
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v1) edge (v2);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v2) edge (v3);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v1) edge (v4);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v4) edge (v3);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v5) edge (v6);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v7) edge (v8);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v8) edge (v9);
\draw [line width = 1pt] (v6) edge (v9);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\xe
%


First off, the truth-conditions seem to imply that \emph{exactly two new plays} is in the scope of \emph{every}, since there are indeed two new plays per quarter back. That establishes on scope relation at least for our quantifier:

\begin{center}
every quarterback $\gg$ two new plays
\end{center}
%
Since there are two new plays \emph{per} quarterbacks, this imply, within Schein's view, that \emph{every} quantifies over singularities. The truth-conditions that the composition must give us will look as follows (unknowns in red, upper case variables range over pluralities, exactly 2 is left unanalysed):

\ex
$\text{\color{red} (three video games?)} \ldots \forall y\in \dbb{quarterback}, \text{Exactly 2 } Z\in \dbb{plays},  \dbb{give}({\color{red} ?})(y)({\color{red} ?})(e)$
\xe
%
Initially, Schein asks us to disregard the scope of the event closure (essentially closing it very locally). That being out of the way,
the real puzzle is \emph{three video-games}. Is it interpreted distributively, as a plural, or as something else? Relatedly, Schein leaves open the option of interpreting the two new plays distributively or not.

\paragraph{Option I: plural interpretation} The simplest option is to interpreted \emph{three video games} and \emph{exactly two new plays} as plural. This gives the following LF:

\ex\label{lf1}
$\exists X\in \dbb{video-games}, |X| = 3 \wedge \forall y\in \dbb{quarterback}, \underline{\text{Exactly 2 } Z\in \dbb{plays},  \dbb{give}(X)(y)(Z)(e)}$
\xe
%
Breaking down the evaluation of \clastx in manageable pieces, we first need to know of which $X$ and $y$ the underlined part is true. In other words, for each quarterback, we need to know which video-games taught him exactly two new plays. Schein provides the following answer:

\pex
\a for \emph{quarterback 1}, \emph{video-game 1} taught him exactly two plays
\a for \emph{quarterback 2}, \emph{video-game 2}$\oplus$\emph{video-game 3} taught him exactly two plays
\xe
%
One wonders why this is so. Couldn't we say that all three video-games taught \emph{quarterback 2} exactly two new plays? Sure, video-game 1 didn't contribute much to that but, as a group, they sure taught that quarterback two new plays.

Schein brushes off this team credit concern by pointing out that video-games are inanimate and need not have any particular link to each other to be true\footnote{Using the word \emph{team credit} kind of imposes restrictions on what we think the phenomenon is. Within that mindset, Schein's reply is valid. But if team credit is nothing but a special case of a more general mechanism of non-maximality, then it fails to adress the bigger question: could we get the three video-games to teach teach \emph{qurterback 2} exactly two new plays if we allow for non-maximality?}. If we accept his rebuttal, then \cref{lf1} indeed comes out as false, contrary to fact: there is no plurality $X$ that is related to every quarterback $y$ by two new plays.

In a nutshell, this LF requires the same set of video-games to have taught every quarterback. Schein brushes off other possible interpretations and notes that the correct truth-conditions can be paraphrased as follows:

\ex%
[each quarterback was \underline{taught} two new plays] and [the \underline{teachers} were three video-games]
\xe
%
This paraphrase can only be obtained if we have at least two operators in our LF, each encoding one of the two red predicates. This means some form of separation.
